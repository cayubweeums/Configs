## Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator
#
#
#Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions in character columns and lines
  # Falls back to size specified by window manager if set to 0x0.
  # (changes require restart)
  dimensions:
    columns: 105
    lines: 35

  # Adds this many blank pixels of padding around the window
  # Units are physical pixels; this is not DPI aware.
  # (change requires restart)
  padding:
    x: 2
    y: 2

  opacity: 0.8

  decorations: none

# Display tabs using this many cells (changes require restart)
tabspaces: 4

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#
# * hintstyle
# * antialias
# * lcdfilter
# * rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to "none". If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to false.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig

font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  normal:
    family: monospace # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Regular

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: monospace # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: monospace # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Italic

  # Point size of the font
  size: 12.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Scale the font size based on the monitor's DPI. This will lead to bigger text on HiDPI
  # screens and make reading text a little easier.
  # On X11 it is possible to change the DPI for each instance of alacritty by using
  # `WINIT_HIDPI_FACTOR=1.0 alacritty` to scale the font.
  #scale_with_dpi: true
  # OS X only: use thin stroke font rendering. Thin strokes are suitable
  # for retina displays, but for non-retina you probably want this set to
  # false.

# and cursor.background colors, otherwise invert the colors of the cursor.

  # Faux Scrollback
  #
  # The `faux_scrollback_lines` setting controls the number

  # To disable this completely, set `faux_scrollback_lines` to 0.
