This ansible playbook, adapted from https://github.com/89luca89/ansible-fedora-minimal and https://github.com/LearnLinuxTV/personal_ansible_desktop_configs, that aims to setup a minimal, yet fully featured, instance of Fedora Everything Minimal starting from a minimal netinstall. Currently, the most recent kernel update 5.16.5 broke the fedora minimal netinstall and this ansible now only works with the basic desktop option.
