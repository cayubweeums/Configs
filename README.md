# Configs

## Purpose
Hold all of my various install scripts for any Linux distro I spend time in.
This repo will allow me to feel comfortable breaking things.


## Distros Included

`From iso Installs`
- Base Arch Install from iso
  - This Install script is a fork from [ArchTitus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus)

`Post iso Installs`

- Garuda
- Fedora

`Ansible Scripts`
- Fedora

## Configs Included
Almost all of the scripts should install all of the packages I use. They should also configure any system tweaks I normally do on my own. As such, most of my .dotfiles are included in the differing scripts.

At the very least there should be a readme.md or some form of post-install.txt file detailing the steps I would take to get my desktop setup.
